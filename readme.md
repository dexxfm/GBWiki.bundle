**Giantbomb Wiki Game Video Capture Agent for Plex**



I looked but could not find anything good that would categorize my game capture footage, so based off "TheGameDB.bundle", I rewrote it to us your personal giantbomb API to pull wiki data and update the video's metadata. It also puts the video in a collection.

Please list any bugs (and fixes if you gott'em). I would love to dig more into how the collections work and make posters and descriptions show up there.

The agent uses your giantbomb API key. You will have to retrieve that yourself. See this link for more information: https://www.giantbomb.com/api/
