TheGamesDB Metadata Agent for Plex
----------------------------------

Nothing fancy, just a plugin for [Plex Media Server](https://plex.tv/).

This allows that software to automatically download metadata about video games (roms, executables, whatever) and display that metadata within its own interface. Plex Media Server does not currently (and probably never will) support video games as a valid media type. However, if you just want a way to visually display what video games you do have, this will list them quite nicely with all relevant details.

If you want to use this, it will be necessary to also install a scanner plugin for Plex for it to recognize the rom files. I'll make that available shortly (just as soon as I can clean it up, it's pretty nasty.)

That's all I have to say. Now it's time to go be nagged by unexpected indentation error messages.
